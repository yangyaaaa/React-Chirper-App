# Chirper Project

This is a base app like tweeter which people can like or reply to other people's tweets,
and also post their own tweets. The App is using an imitated api and data which offer by the course.

Combining React and Redux, the UI components and the actions and datas are all separated.
but it shows exactly how the data interactionin runs in a really world.

This repo is a code-along with the first project in the React Nanodegree program.

Most of the commits in this repository correspond to videos in the program.
